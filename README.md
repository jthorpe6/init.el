# init.el

It took me years to setup emacs the way I like it. Yet I've switched to vscode now. But it would feel wrong deleting what took me 5 years to configure. So this is mainly here for archive reasons.

I started using emacs in the terminal, then I switched to using it in the GUI, and recently I've switched back to using it in the terminal so its out of the way.

## Installation

If you want to see what my config ended up as you can install this config like so.

```
git clone https://github.com/jthorpe6/init.el.git ~/.emacs.d && \
    cd ~/.emacs.d && \
    emacs
```

The config did install the packages when I tried it last, but just in case.. Here be dragons!
